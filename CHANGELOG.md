## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-09

### Legacy PRD Wave Closed — DASH3-005 + TOKEN-007

Two pre-v1.2.6 deferred stories picked up after the v1.3.0 reliability wave unblocked their prerequisites. Both shipped via parallel agents with no overlap.

- **DASH3-005 — Cognitive Insight v2 (factor-change surfacing)**
  - `68e80a3` feat(DASH3-005): Cognitive Insight v2 factor-deltas surfacing
  - New `client/src/hooks/useFactorDeltas.ts` + `factorDeltas.helpers.ts` + 21 unit tests
  - New `client/src/components/explainer/FactorDeltas.tsx` rendered as sibling to CognitiveInsight on Dashboard
  - Computes deltas client-side from existing factor exposures + localStorage baseline (no new ML endpoint required); falls back to `kind: 'empty'` until baseline accumulates
  - Reuses DataSource discriminated union from US-002, Sparkline component from existing UI, no new npm dependencies
  - `data-testid="visual-dashboard-ready"` added for TOKEN-007 wait anchor

- **TOKEN-007 — Visual regression infrastructure**
  - `8887c14` feat(TOKEN-007): visual regression infra, Playwright + nightly CI
  - `b1a717a` test(TOKEN-007): visual regression baselines, Landing light + dark
  - `1127359` fix(TOKEN-007): valid YAML for nightly workflow step name
  - `tests/visual/playwright.config.cjs` + `tests/visual/tokens.spec.ts` (18 tests = 9 pages x 2 themes)
  - `.github/workflows/visual-regression.yml` runs nightly at 06:00 UTC, NOT per-PR (per original deferral guidance)
  - `data-testid="visual-{page}-ready"` anchors added across Landing, Portfolio, Trading, Options, CVRF, Earnings, Factors, Alerts (Dashboard had its anchor added by DASH3-005)
  - 2 of 18 baselines committed (Landing light + dark); the remaining 16 need `npm run test:visual:update` run once with operator credentials (`SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` + `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) to seed the golden-state user and capture
  - `chromium`-only, `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01`, on-failure CI uploads `playwright-report/` + `test-results/` artifacts

**Legacy PRD inventory after this wave:**
- `prd-dashboard-v3.json`: 7 of 8 done (DASH3-006 personalization deferred until 2nd active user)
- `prd-mobile-portfolio.json`: 6 of 7 done (MOBILE-004 swipe actions deferred until 2nd active user)
- `prd-motion-system.json`: archived to `.prd-archive/` (7 of 7 complete)
- `prd-token-migration.json`: 7 of 7 done

## [1.3.2] - 2026-05-09

### Risk Metrics Empty State (sparse-factor leak closed)

- `3ce23ee` fix(dashboard): Risk Metrics empty when factor data sparse
- `c1302eb` audit: v1.3.2 dashboard with Risk Metrics empty state
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx::calculateMetrics()` returns `null` when `positions.length === 0` OR market/volatility factors not yet computed; caller wraps `null` in `EMPTY` DataSource so the existing `kind === 'empty'` branch renders clean placeholders ("Add positions to compute this metric")
- Removed unused `EMPTY_METRICS` zero-seed object that was the source of the prior derived-defaults leak (Sharpe 0.28, Vol 18%, Drawdown -27% looked real but were CAPM stand-ins)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-09

### Auth-chain hotfixes (post-v1.3.0 walkthrough)

- Three sites used `localStorage.getItem('supabase_token')` (wrong key); all replaced with `supabase.auth.getSession()` or `useAuthStore.getState().session`
- Dashboard portfolio fetch was returning the API envelope as Portfolio; now unwraps `json.data || json.portfolio || json`
- `Number(undefined)` produces `NaN` and `NaN ?? fallback` does NOT fall through; replaced with `Number.isFinite(portRaw) ? portRaw : 3000` in health probe URL builder
- `digest/run` route added `?probe=true` short-circuit because Vercel rewrites `HEAD` to `GET` on `/api/(.*)` catch-all routes (broke health probe gate-only pattern)
- `JSON.stringify(undefined)` returns `undefined`; ErrorCounter raw string capture now uses `JSON.stringify(error) ?? String(error)`
- `useNotifications.ts` subscription helpers swapped to live session reads

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-09

### End-User Reliability Wave — 9 user stories shipped via 3 waves of parallel agents

The v1.2.6 walkthrough exposed a deeper structural problem: 740 tests passed
while `/api/v1/portfolio` 404'd for everyone in production. Test counts and
integration health flags lied. v1.3.0 closes that class of "boundary bugs"
AND threads in five compounding patterns so each fix produces durable
infrastructure beyond the immediate bug.

**Stories shipped (in three parallel waves):**

- **US-001 — Architecture refresh + machine-checkable arch contract**
  - `d1fd833` chore(docs): refresh ARCHITECTURE + CONTEXT current state
  - `56e54ac` feat(scripts): arch-scanner + schemas/arch.json + CI hook
  - Operations runbook (daily / weekly / incident playbook / rotation runbook / upgrade triggers)
  - Auth state machine documented in ARCHITECTURE.md

- **US-002 — Mock-data integrity + DataSource type contract**
  - `6f392af` feat(integrity): DataSource<T> type contract + 6-page mock-data audit
  - New `client/src/lib/dataSource.ts` discriminated union; mock-data leaks now TS errors
  - Dashboard / ML / Tax / Alerts / Options / Earnings audited for fabricated state

- **US-003 — Auth lifecycle hardening (eliminate cold-load 401 race)**
  - `aaceecb` feat(auth): isReady flag + ProtectedRoute gate
  - `e210990` feat(auth): 401 retry-with-refresh in API interceptor
  - 6 hooks gated on `isReady && session?.access_token`
  - ARCHITECTURE.md auth lifecycle diagram refined with predicates + render permissions

- **US-004 — Health probe upgrade (real upstream calls + standardized shape)**
  - `b8594fd` feat(health): real-upstream probes + standardized shape + JSON Schema
  - 7 real-upstream probes (Polygon, AV, Stripe, Resend, Supabase, ConnectAlpaca crypto, weekly digest cron)
  - `IntegrationHealthEntry` type extended with `latencyMs / lastError / lastSuccessAt / ttlSeconds`
  - `schemas/health-integration.json` + ajv runtime validation

- **US-005 — WebSocket UX + reusable DegradedService primitive**
  - `0df78bd` feat(ws): wsClient.resetWebSocket() user-initiated reset
  - `7edb80d` feat(ui): <DegradedService> primitive + ConnectionStatus refactor
  - Reusable for future degraded paths (rate limiter, AI explainer, billing webhook lag)

- **US-006 — Provider rate-limit architecture + extracted cache module**
  - `a4ab925` feat(cache): extracted Memory/Supabase/Composite cache module + tests (18 new)
  - `7aea9f5` refactor(market-data): MarketDataProvider uses CompositeCache
  - `84ad491` feat(cache): CacheWarmer + boot-time warm + hourly cron + README upgrade callout
  - `inflightHistoricalPrices` request coalescing preserved separately
  - Hand-rolled `ConcurrencyLimiter(4)` for Polygon free-tier ceiling

- **US-007 — Authenticated smoke tests + golden state + synthetic monitor**
  - `153a8d6` feat(test): integration auth-helper + golden-state fixture
  - `1a45356` feat(test): protected routes smoke suite + api-shape schema
  - `89e7fd8` feat(observability): synthetic monitor fills US-008 stub with smoke assertions
  - 17 assertions across 13 protected routes, schema-validated via ajv
  - Synthetic monitor cron runs every 15 minutes against production
  - Golden state fixture (`tests/fixtures/golden-state.sql`) reusable for screenshots / smoke / support

- **US-008 — Observability (error counter + request tracing + weekly digest)**
  - `1cbc81d` feat(observability): error counter + request tracing + weekly health digest
  - `ErrorCounter` singleton; `RequestTracing` middleware threads `X-Request-Id` client → server → console
  - Weekly health-summary email cron (Sundays 13:00 UTC)
  - Synthetic monitor results auto-feed `errorCounter`

- **US-009 — Env audit + schema-driven contract**
  - `83f0425` feat(env): schema-driven contract + audit script + CI hook
  - `schemas/env-schema.json` declares every production env var with regex/length contracts
  - `scripts/audit-env.mjs` lint mode + full-audit mode
  - GitHub Action runs weekly + on every PR that touches env references

**Compounding outputs delivered (the durable yield):**
- 5 reusable primitives: `DataSource<T>`, `<DegradedService>`, `MemoryCache`/`SupabaseCache`/`CompositeCache`, `auth-helper.mintTestSession()`, `RequestTracing`
- 4 machine-checkable schemas: `arch.json`, `env-schema.json`, `health-integration.json`, `api-shape.json`
- 1 documented state machine: auth lifecycle
- 1 golden-state fixture: canonical seeded test user
- 1 operations runbook: daily / weekly / incident / rotation / upgrade triggers
- 1 synthetic monitor: production smoke tests on 15-min cron sharing CI assertions

**Tests:** 740 (v1.2.6) → **765 passing**, 41 test files, ~3 second runtime.

**New cron entries:** `/api/v1/cron/warm-cache` (hourly), `/api/v1/digest/health-summary` (Sundays 13:00 UTC), `/api/v1/cron/synthetic-monitor` (every 15 min).

## [1.2.6] - 2026-05-08

### End-user walkthrough fixes — 9 user stories shipped via parallel agents

Walked the production app as fresh enterprise dev account
(`dicoangelo+dev@metaventionsai.com`), captured 20 screenshots into
`.audit-2026-05-08/walkthrough/`, and shipped the resulting fix queue
through ralph-tui PRD `tasks/prd-v1.2.6-walkthrough-fixes.md` with 8
parallel agent sessions across 2 waves.

**P0 fixes (caught during the walkthrough itself, before the PRD):**
- `5277a74` `fix(portfolio): wire useDatabase + currentPortfolio in AppServer` —
  every authed `GET /api/v1/portfolio` returned 404 because `server.useDatabase`
  was never declared on `AppServer`. Now reads `Boolean(SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY)`.
- `70e67c7` `fix(portfolio): React error #310 — move hooks above early returns` —
  `useMemo`/`useCountUp` lived below an `if (isLoading) return ...`. Loading→loaded
  transition tripped React's hook-order check.

**Wave 1 (5 parallel agents):**
- `06d89ae` `fix(factors): per-symbol resilience in /portfolio/factors handler (US-001)`
  — bad ticker no longer 500s the whole batch
- `d5a1749` `fix(display-name): strip +suffix aliases from email greeting (US-003)` —
  greeting now reads "Dicoangelo" not "Dicoangelo+dev"
- `e48d965` `feat(nav): add Backtest entry to sidebar Intelligence group (US-004)` —
  Backtest reachable from sidebar (was orphaned at `/backtest`)
- `1b04a65` `fix(onboarding): soften welcome modal + persist dismissal (US-008)` —
  halo gradient instead of saturated sovereign, 44x44 close X, localStorage-backed
  dismissal
- `ee86990` `feat(dashboard): real 7D sparkline + change in HoldingsTable (US-009)`
  — replaced seeded-PRNG mock sparkline with real 7-day prices via
  `getHistoricalPrices`; new `quotesApi.getHistoricalPrices` route +
  client module

**Wave 2 (3 parallel agents):**
- `fb3aed5` `fix(ws): repair Railway handshake (US-006)` — root cause was
  `@fastify/websocket@^10` v8 API mismatch on Railway (`connection.socket.on`
  was undefined). Server-side shim handles both v7 and v8+ shapes; client-side
  defense-in-depth abandons WS after 3 failed reconnects so the banner enters
  a terminal "Live Feed Offline · Polling Fallback" state instead of looping
  "Reconnecting · 1 · 1s" forever
- `fd10c4c` `fix(dashboard): empty state when no positions (US-005)` —
  authenticated users with zero positions now see `<EmptyPortfolio>` instead
  of a fake $125K demo. Public landing flow unchanged
- `4bf26ee` `fix(mock-data): MockDataBanner across Tax/ML/Alerts/Social/Options (US-007)`
  — every page that displays demo / placeholder data now shows a dismissible
  banner. `MockDataBanner` gained `force`, `pageKey`, `dismissible`, `message`
  props with per-page localStorage persistence
- `791292f` `fix(cvrf): repair page crash on fresh user (US-002)` — root cause
  was a client/server API shape mismatch on `/api/v1/cvrf/stats` (server
  returns `factorWeights`, client typed as `weights`). Added 3 normalizer
  functions in `client/src/api/cvrf.ts` + defensive null-coalescing across 9
  CVRF components + page-level `SectionErrorBoundary`

**Net:** 11 commits, 0 known production crashes, mock-data-leak fully closed.
Audit + screenshots captured in `.audit-2026-05-08/walkthrough/AUDIT.md`.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-05-08

### Rate limiter goes durable on Supabase + IP extractor fix — no Upstash needed

Replaced the in-memory rate limiter with a Supabase-backed counter so limits
survive Vercel cold starts without adding a new vendor. At Frontier Alpha's
scale, Postgres handles the load just fine; the third-party Redis dependency
isn't worth the ops cost.

- **Added** `frontier_rate_limits` table + `rate_limit_check(text,int,int)`
  Postgres RPC that does an atomic UPSERT (window-rolls when expired,
  increments otherwise) in a single round-trip.
- **Added** `rate_limit_cleanup()` housekeeping function — call from a cron
  if the table grows long-tail.
- **Changed** `src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts` — new `SupabaseRateLimiterStore`
  class wraps the RPC, falls back to the in-memory store on RPC error so a
  Postgres blip cannot wedge the API. Mode auto-selects based on
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` presence.
- **Changed** `/api/v1/health/integrations.rateLimiter` — reports
  `provider: 'supabase-postgres'`, `mode: 'rate_limit_check RPC'` when
  Supabase is the active store.
- **Fixed** `getClientIp()` was reading `x-forwarded-for[0]` which on Vercel
  silently rotated to a PoP IP (216.73.162.x range) instead of the real
  client IP — every request looked like a fresh client and never hit limits.
  New extractor prefers `x-vercel-forwarded-for` → `cf-connecting-ip` →
  `x-real-ip` → XFF → `request.ip`.
- **Result** — 13 of 14 integrations live (only Vercel WS by-design remains
  degraded). No Upstash signup required.

---

## [1.2.4] - 2026-05-08

### Fix: WebSocket Offline · Data Stale + Stripe checkout failure + Terms/Privacy

Both regressions traced to the same root cause — every `VITE_*` env on Vercel
carried a literal `\n` because earlier sessions used `echo | vercel env add`.
A literal `\n` is *truthy* in JavaScript, so:

- `VITE_API_URL="\n"` short-circuited the WS URL precedence, building
  `"\n/ws/quotes"` → invalid → fell all the way to polling → "Offline · Data Stale"
- `VITE_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID="price_...\n"` got baked into the SPA bundle, so
  the checkout POST sent a price ID with a trailing newline → Stripe rejected
  it → checkout silently failed

Fixes:
- **Reset all 7 `VITE_*` envs** on Vercel cleanly via `printf` (no trailing newline)
- **Defense-in-depth** in `client/src/api/websocket.ts::getWebSocketUrl()` — now
  `.trim()`s every env read so a future env mishap can't recreate this. Also
  guards against double-appending `/ws/quotes` if the env already includes the
  path.
- **Out of scope (transient):** Supabase rate-limited /auth/recover with 429
  after multiple forgot-password attempts. Resolves itself in ~30 min; not a
  code bug.

### Added: Terms of Service + Privacy Policy

- New `/terms` and `/privacy` routes (`client/src/pages/Terms.tsx`,
  `Privacy.tsx`) following the family aesthetic — sovereign-bar, halo gradient
  title, glass surfaces.
- Login footer text now wraps "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" in
  links that open in a new tab.
- Landing footer adds Terms and Privacy entries next to Sign In / Documentation / API.

---

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-08

### Health endpoint surfaces v1.2.x integrations

Production diagnostic now reflects what actually shipped. `GET /api/v1/health/integrations`
adds three new entries and trims a stale env newline that was leaking into the
provider field.

- **Added** `connectAlpaca` entry — round-trip probes `BROKER_CRED_ENC_KEY` via
  `isCryptoReady()` so a malformed key surfaces here instead of waiting for the
  first user to hit `POST /api/v1/broker/connect`.
- **Added** `weeklyDigestCron` entry — surfaces `CRON_SECRET` presence so
  operators know whether the Monday 13:00 UTC Vercel cron can authorize.
- **Added** `compGuard` entry — informational status that the comp-customer
  webhook protection is wired (always live, code-only).
- **Fixed** `provider: "resend\n"` — env values from `vercel env add` can carry
  trailing newlines, so the email entry now `.trim()`s the provider before
  echoing it.

Total integrations surfaced: 13 (was 11). Frontier Alpha v1.2.x feature wiring
is now fully observable from a single endpoint.

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-08

### Comp customer guard — billing webhooks cannot clobber comp rows

Comp/founder accounts are seeded with sentinel `comp_*` IDs in
`stripe_customer_id` and `stripe_subscription_id`. Real Stripe customer IDs
are `cus_*` so the formats can never collide, but this release makes the
protection explicit at every mutation site:

- **Added** `isCompCustomerByUserId()` helper + `COMP_PREFIX` sentinel in
  `src/routes/billing.ts`.
- **Changed** `POST /api/v1/billing/checkout` — refuses to create a Stripe
  Checkout Session for a user whose subscription row carries comp IDs (409
  `COMP_ACCOUNT`).
- **Changed** `checkout.session.completed` webhook — skips the upsert and
  logs `Skipping checkout.session.completed upsert for comp account` when
  the inbound `metadata.userId` belongs to a comp account.
- **Changed** `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`,
  and `invoice.payment_failed` webhook branches — added explicit
  `.not('stripe_customer_id', 'like', 'comp_%')` clause as defense-in-depth.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-08

### Weekly digest — real metrics

Replaced the stubbed portfolio numbers in the Monday-morning digest with live values
from `portfolioService` + `marketDataProvider`. Each per-position 7-day return is computed
against an actual prior close (Alpha Vantage TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED, Supabase-cached)
and the largest dollar swing is surfaced as the "because" line on the top-mover card.

- **Added** `src/notifications/digest-metrics.ts` — `computeWeeklyMetrics(userId)` returns
  portfolio value, 7-day delta, top mover, and worst mover, or `null` when data is too
  thin to render a meaningful digest.
- **Changed** `src/routes/digest.ts` — wires real metrics into `renderWeeklyDigest`,
  skips users whose portfolio cannot be resolved instead of sending a zeroed-out email.
- **Failure posture** — per-symbol fetch errors are logged and skipped; one bad ticker
  no longer poisons the run.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Backend integration wave — 9 of 11 integrations live, two-tier deployment

This release closes the live-services gap. Stripe billing, DeepSeek explanation, Resend email,
VAPID web push, and an internal SimulatedBroker all moved from "wired-but-dormant" to
production-active. A second deployment tier (Railway) was introduced to host the long-lived
Polygon WebSocket that Vercel's serverless runtime cannot keep open. PRs #10–#13.

### Added

- **SimulatedBroker** — internal paper trading engine. Fills against the live Polygon WebSocket
  (Railway tier) and persists into Supabase tables `paper_accounts`, `paper_orders`,
  `paper_positions` with RLS. Replaces the read-only demo path; no external broker dependency.
- **Stripe live billing** — Pro ($29/mo) and Enterprise ($99/mo) products created via the Stripe
  API with stable `lookup_keys`, idempotent provisioning script (`scripts/create-stripe-products.mjs`),
  webhook endpoint registered, signing secret wired. Subscription state flows through
  `useSubscription` and `UpgradeGate`.
- **DeepSeek V4 explainer** — preferred LLM provider for `ExplanationService`. OpenAI remains
  supported as a fallback. Selection is provider-agnostic: `DeepSeek > OpenAI > template`.
- **Resend email** — alerts and transactional sends. Four new templates: welcome, alert digest,
  billing receipt, billing failure.
- **VAPID web push** — keys self-generated; both server (`PushService`) and client (subscription
  flow) wired end-to-end.
- **Railway deployment tier** — second runtime at `frontier-alpha-api-production.up.railway.app`
  hosting the standalone Fastify build with WebSocket support. Custom subdomain
  `api.frontier-alpha.metaventionsai.com` pending TLS provisioning. Same codebase, different
  runtime mode (long-lived vs serverless).
- **Two-tier deployment architecture** — Vercel hosts the SPA + REST API; Railway hosts
  long-lived WebSocket. Client uses `VITE_WS_URL` to point at Railway and `VITE_API_URL=''` for
  same-origin REST.
- **Subscription gating UI** — `UpgradeGate` component + `useSubscription` hook lock Pro features
  behind active subscription state.
- **Stripe checkout return flow** — `BillingSuccess` and `BillingCanceled` pages handle the
  Stripe-hosted checkout redirect handoff.
- **`/api/v1/health/integrations`** — diagnostic endpoint reporting per-integration status
  (live / unwired / degraded).
- **Operational scripts** — `scripts/wire-production-env.sh`, `scripts/wire-deepseek.sh`,
  `scripts/wire-vapid.sh`, `scripts/wire-stripe-webhook.mjs`, `scripts/create-stripe-products.mjs`.

### Changed

- **`ExplanationService`** — provider-agnostic. Resolution order: DeepSeek → OpenAI → template.
  Previously OpenAI-only.
- **`SentimentAnalyzer`** — three-tier resolution. FinBERT → LLM (DeepSeek) → keyword fallback.
  With `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set, the service moves out of the previous degraded keyword-only mode
  into `llm-classification` mode.
- **Trading page banner** — `READ-ONLY DEMO MODE` replaced with `PAPER TRADING · Frontier Alpha
  Engine`. Reflects the SimulatedBroker now backing live order flow.
- **Demo workflow** — landing → signup → dashboard handoff now preserves preview symbols across
  the auth boundary.

### Fixed

- **Vercel client missed Supabase env** — the client wasn't reading `VITE_*`-prefixed Supabase
  variables. Realigned env names and verified through the Vercel build pipeline.
- **Graceful degradation** — UI now degrades cleanly when an integration is unwired
  (no console flooding, contained error UI). Confirmed against the
  `/api/v1/health/integrations` matrix.

### Pending

- **Upstash Redis** — still pending. Free signup not yet completed. Rate limiter falls back to
  in-memory (single-instance correct, multi-instance soft).

**Production:** https://frontier-alpha.metaventionsai.com (Vercel) +
https://frontier-alpha-api-production.up.railway.app (Railway, custom subdomain pending TLS).
Deployed 2026-05-08.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### UI: family-aesthetic polish across 35 files

Comprehensive visual rev aligning Frontier Alpha with the rest of the Metaventions AI family
(`metaventionsai.com`, `careers.metaventionsai.com`, `friendlyface.metaventionsai.com`). Five rounds,
two PRs (#3 + #4), 35 files modified.

#### Added

- **Four missing keyframes** in `client/src/index.css` — `animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-in-left`,
  `animate-slide-in-right`, `animate-pulse-subtle`. These were referenced site-wide but only declared in
  the reduced-motion override, causing every animated overlay/sidebar/toast to land as a hard cut. Now
  bound to motion tokens (`--motion-duration-base`, `--motion-duration-slow`, `--motion-ease-out`).
- **`ModelStatusBanner` pattern** — reusable status banner with type-colored 3px rail and shadow glow,
  shared across CVRF / Backtest / ML / Earnings / Trading.
- **`SectionShell` wrapper** — consistent section frame for Settings, APIKeys, Help.
- **`ToggleRow` component** — settings toggle with sovereign-gradient track, used across Settings + APIKeys.
- **Sovereign-gradient input ring** across all forms (LoginForm, SignupForm, Settings, APIKeys).
- **Sovereign-bar (3px gradient top rail)** on every modal and page header — CommandPalette, BottomSheet,
  KeyboardHelpModal, WelcomeModal, FeatureTour, MobileNav, Pricing.
- **Mono kicker register** — `mono text-[10px] sm:text-xs tracking-[0.3em] uppercase text-theme-muted` —
  applied as the canonical small-label register across Header, PortfolioOverview, MarketStatusStrip,
  EquityCurve, intelligence pages, execution pages.
- **`tabular-nums`** on every numeric metric (anti-jitter on streaming quotes, time displays, equity curve
  values, position rows).

#### Changed

- **Buttons** — replaced `transition-all` + `hover-scale` (janky on focus) with `animate-press` +
  `animate-lift` + brightness-filter hover. New token-based vocabulary across the entire interaction layer.
- **Toasts** — flat tinted backgrounds → `glass-slab-floating` + 3px type-colored left rail + colored
  shadow glow. Toast pattern now reused for SectionErrorBoundary, ConnectionStatus, MockDataBanner,
  ModelStatusBanner, banners in Earnings/Trading.
- **ErrorBoundary** — rogue `--color-info` blue "Try Again" button replaced with sovereign gradient.
  Full-page boundary now uses `glass-slab-floating` + sovereign-bar. SectionErrorBoundary adopts the Toast
  banner pattern.
- **Sidebar active state** — color swap → sovereign-gradient `before:` pseudo rail. Section dividers grouped.
  Upsell card upgraded to gradient CTA.
- **Pricing page** — full rebuild with `grid-bg` shell, `holo-pulse` hero, `border-sovereign` on Pro tier.
- **Settings + APIKeys** — `SectionShell` pattern, canonical inputs, `ToggleRow` with sovereign-gradient
  track, segmented theme switcher, Danger Zone with red rail.
- **Forms** — LoginForm + SignupForm canonical input pattern with focus rings; glass-slab error blocks.
- **Sidebar.tsx, Header.tsx, MobileNav.tsx, BottomSheet.tsx, CommandPalette.tsx, PullToRefresh.tsx** —
  layout chrome upgraded to family aesthetic; sovereign-violet glow on PullToRefresh; glass-modal on sheets.
- **PortfolioOverview** — `text-gradient-brand` hero with `holo-pulse`. **EquityCurve** — segmented
  timeframe pills, fixed `h-64` chart wrapper. **MarketStatusStrip** — glass-slab pills with type rails.
- **Intelligence pages** — CVRF, Backtest, ML adopt ModelStatusBanner pattern, page-header polish.
- **Execution pages** — Trading, Options, Earnings, Tax adopt segmented controls and mono uppercase tables.
- **Help / onboarding** — Help, Social, KeyboardHelpModal, HelpPanel, HelpButton, WelcomeModal, FeatureTour
  unified under sovereign-bar modal pattern.

#### Fixed

- **CLS on Dashboard** — `min-h` set on every chart wrapper, status-pill stable width, `tabular-nums` on
  the streaming time display. No more layout shift on first quote tick.
- **Hard-cut overlay transitions** — the four keyframes (`fade-in`, `slide-in-left`, `slide-in-right`,
  `pulse-subtle`) were referenced across the codebase but undefined except inside the reduced-motion
  override. Defining them at the document level restores the intended animations everywhere.
- **Skeletons** — three skeleton files rebuilt to match final shapes (eliminates skeleton-to-content
  pop on first render).
